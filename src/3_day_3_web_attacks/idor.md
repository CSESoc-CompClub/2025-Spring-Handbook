# IDOR

> [!INFO] What is IDOR?
> [IDOR](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor) stands for _Insecure Direct Object Reference_ and it is a type of vulnerability that occurs when websites use user-provided input without first doing some checks.

## How IDOR Works

IDOR vulnerabilities typically occur when an application exposes internal object references (like database keys, filenames, or user IDs) in URLs, form parameters, or API endpoints without proper authorization checks.

> [!TIP] Examples
> For example, consider a url that you may have seen before in the past:
> `www.examplewebsite.com/orders/123`
>
> If the application doesn't verify that the current user is authorized to view order #123, an attacker could simply change the number to access other users' orders:
> Like this:
>
> - `www.examplewebsite.com/orders/124`
> - `www.examplewebsite.com/orders/125`
> - `www.examplewebsite.com/orders/1`
>
> ## IDOR vulnerabilities can be found in various contexts:
>
> - **User profiles**: `/user/profile?id=456`
> - **File downloads**: `/download?file=document123.pdf`
> - **API endpoints**: `/api/users/789/messages`
> - **Database records**: `/invoice?invoice_id=ABC123`
> - **Support tickets**: `/ticket/14`

> [!SUCCESS] Tasks
>
> 1. Find out what page could potentially lead to what we just mentioned.
> 2. After you discover the vulnerability, see what you can do with it. What additional information can you find out?
